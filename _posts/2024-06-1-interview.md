# My Journey in Coding and Teamwork

## Key Interests and How Coding Intersects with Those Interests

Since I was young I have been interested in problem solving and have expressed my interest in hobbies like math and rubixs cubes. As I continued my interest in problem solving I found coding and since the age of 13 i've been coding, problem solving and devolping new projects. I enjoyed coding so much that I took ap computer science to devople my skills in coding more. My interest intersect with coding as they lead me to my coding journy and help me show off my creativity.

## Full Stack Coding Experience

My full-stack coding experiences:

- **Frog searcher**: A program that showcases hundreds of frogs and when clicking on them would display info about them. Also games on the website about frogs and a theme based around frogs.

- **Real Estate**: A platform thats displays houses and is able to sort them by price. Other features on thw website make it so you can save your house to your login and input your salary to see what houe you can afford.

- **Main hub**: A site featuring many different hubs like physical hub, game hub, education hub and meme generator. This showcases all my frontend skills with my different interest like survays, games and learning.

## Overview of Machine Learning Experience

My machine learning experience was complecated for me but in the end I was about to make a rocket prediction simulator using data. We first started with the titanic ML project and editing it to make it better. From there we made our own data and then changed variables and questions to be about rockets.

**Predictive Analytics Model**: Devopled from the titanic ML and made to be about rocket success taking in variables like weight and company.

## GitHub Project and Profile Review

You can find my projects and contributions on my GitHub profile: [GitHub Profile](https://github.com/IshanCornick). 

## Showcasing Projects

I've had the chance to exhibit these projects at various events, including the N@tM (Night at the Museum) in May 2024. Throughout these occasions, we shared our work with a wide and diverse audience through live demonstrations, poster presentations, and interactive Q&A sessions. Attendees from various backgrounds had the opportunity to engage with our applications and offer valuable feedback. This experience not only allowed us to improve our projects but also helped us develop stronger communication and presentation abilities.

## Demo of My Favorite Project

My favorite project is the **Social Media Website**. Hereâ€™s a brief demo:

**Main Hub**: [Organization Link](http://127.0.0.1:4200/student/2024/02/17/main-hub.html)

1. **Main Hub**: Displays all the frontend features
2. **Physical hub**: Users can input info to find recommened workout and diet for there goals
3. **Game Hub**: Users can play a varity of different games
4. **Meme Generator**: Generates a random meme from those saved
5. **Connection to backend**: Meme generator and Physical hub have connections


## N@TM
I was involved with helping with the quick sort algorithm, and the GetSorted functions. I was also involved with formatting the frontend, which we used previous templates to make the tiles.

## Additional Interests

Beyond full-stack development and machine learning, I am also deeply interested in Biomedical Engineering. I am actively learning more about the intersection of ML and biomedical applications. Additionally, I have some experience with R programming, which I am expanding as part of my learning journey. This unique combination of skills and interests positions me well to tackle interdisciplinary challenges and innovate in various fields.

## Unique Qualification

What sets me apart is my ability to seamlessly integrate my technical skills with strong teamwork and communication capabilities. I not only bring a deep understanding of full-stack development and machine learning but also a proven track record of successfully collaborating in diverse teams to deliver high-quality projects. My passion for continuous learning and adaptability to new technologies ensures that I am always ready to tackle the next challenge.
